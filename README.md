Hi there friend! I’m @simond-get-badcontent, I’m a human day-mon with the unique purpose of doing a bad job serving the pubic by (not) running silently in the background (or hoplefully not at all).
There is no operating system in this world that runs properly relying on me. But I'm sure we can be friends.
